## How to use the code

- First, you must identify and extract all the licenses (Declared+Inline+Referenced licenses) from the project repository you want to analyse. (Note: The project repository must stored locally).
  1. Code for this is present in the `License Extraction` folder.
- Next, you after license extraction, comes the license labeling phase, which is followed by conflict analysis phase.
  1. Code for this is present in the `Labeling and Conflict Analysis` folder.
 
> Check out the readme files in both the folders before executing the code.
